## How to find research topics

<!--v-->

### Research topics

- What interested you the most in undergad courses?
  - Questions you asked that didn't have answers
  - Topics that were so interesting you wouldn't mind reading about them in
    your spare time
- What things in the world are interesting to you?
- Come up with questions (even if they are broad):
  - Do people all percieve time the same way?
  - Can emotion be useful for an AI?
  - Do all human lanugages share an underlying structure?

<!--v-->

#### Step 1 - Google your questions

- Find articles / talks 🔍
  - New York Times, Scientific American, TED talks, StackExchange, YouTube, etc.
- Read / watch those 👁️
  - Note the most interesting ones.
  - Who are the scientists & institutions invloved?
- **Read the academic papers they cite** 📄
  - You probably won't understand everything yet
  - That's OK!

<!--v-->

#### Step 2 - Expand your search

- Use Google Scholar to find more papers
  - Search for keywords / vocabulary from the academic papers you read
  - Look at other papers by the same authors
  - Look at papers that cite / are cited by the ones you read

<!--v-->

### <span style="color:black">Connected Papers</span>

<!-- .slide: data-background-iframe="https://www.connectedpapers.com/" data-background-interactive -->

<!--v-->

### <span style="color:black">Neurotree</span>

<!-- .slide: data-background-iframe="https://neurotree.org/neurotree/" data-background-interactive -->

<!--v-->

### Step 3 - Repeat

- Build up a list of questions that interest
  - Note the people who work in these areas
- Join social media related to these topics
  - Follow scientist whose work you like on Twitter
  - Join subreddits for research topics that interest you

<!--s-->

### Other things I wish I'd known

1. Talk to current / former students of potential mentors
   - Websites don't always reflect PI's current interests
   - Different advising styles
   - Hidden details about programs
2. Think about your long term goals
   - Will the programs you are looking for prepare you?
   - (e.g. if you want to teach, will you get teaching experience?)
3. Get into the habit of reading papers
   - It gets easier the more you do it
   - Makes you a stronger applicant and a stronger student
